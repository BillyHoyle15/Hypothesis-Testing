# Hypothesis-Testing
Basic hypothesis testing examples for different situations

Before making any analysis, we should formulate a hypothesis. Hypothesis is our (or the porject's) idea that can be tested.
Hypothesis testing has two parts; Null Hypothesis (H0) and Alternative Hypothesis (H1)
Null Hypothesis (H0) is the one to b tested and we are trying to reject the Null Hypothesis. We state our opinion in Alternative Hypothesis and if we reject Null Hypothesis (it is the present state), we prove our opinion.
